### Getting Started

#### Package requirements

To create projects that use WebView2, your projects must include both the `WinNativeForms` package and the `WebView2` package in your projects.  

Both of these packages can be added through the `Project` > `References` menu option, and selecting the `TWINPACK PACKAGES` button.  Ensure both packages are ticked, and then close and save the Settings file and restart the compiler.

Once you've added the package references, you should find that the WebView2 control is now available to you in the form designer:

#### Create a WebView2 control on a form

We use the WebView2 control just like any ordinary control:

#### WebView2 control properties

There are lots of WebView2 properties and events to experiment with.

Note that toggling any property will show extra information at the bottom of the properties list to give you a little bit more information.  For further information on a particular property, try searching the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/">WebView2 documentation</a>

## Samples
